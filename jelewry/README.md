This is my project and contains several files: 1- Index.html 2- Style.css 3- Script.js 4- Images file I've been thinking a lot about what to bring to cs50 for the final project. And as a result, I made a website using html , Css, JavaScript This website can simply be a store and everything will definitely change with the development of technology A jewelry store website is definitely a good way to showcase products, which makes jewelry stores more secure one part of this website that I like very much is the blog section we can also communicate more with customers in the blog section.
